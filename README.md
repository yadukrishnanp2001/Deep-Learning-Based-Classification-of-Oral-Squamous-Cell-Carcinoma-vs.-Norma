# Deep-Learning-Based-Classification-of-OSCC vs.-Norma

Because of its rising frequency and natural difficulties in early identification and effective treatment planning, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a serious worldwide health issue. Improved patient outcomes and survival rates depend on early diagnosis. Effective treatment is still hampered by delayed diagnosis even although knowledge of the molecular processes behind OSCC has improved greatly. Customized to specific patient profiles, precision medicine is becoming increasingly important. Including deep learning algorithms into clinical procedures shows great potential for early detection and therapy planning.

In this work, we assess using medical imaging data two convolutional neural network (CNN) models applied to OSCC detection. Custom-designed CNN architecture attained an F1 score of 80\%, a recall of 71\%, and a precision of 71\%. By contrast, with a precision of 81\%, an F1 score of 86\%, and a recall of 79\%, a pretrained DenseNet model produced better performance. These results highlight the possibilities of deep learning approaches to assist pathologists and doctors by means of automated, high-accuracy image interpretation, therefore enabling more timely and successful interventions in OSCC care.
